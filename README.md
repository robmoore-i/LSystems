# Coding night: L-Systems

## Format

- Groups of 3-5 people sitting round a table, each with a laptop and the code.

- I stand at the front and say "The business says that they need _", you have 10 minutes, go ahead.

- After everyone is done, everyone passes their laptop around one place to the left, and receives a laptop from their
right. I then give another task, and this continues for a few goes.

- At the end, everyone should have a different implementation of the "Dragon Curve" L-system. We will also
discuss the effect of the laptop-passing, how people managed it, what did you like about code you received, what did
you not like, etc.

## Tasks

I don't really know exactly what the scope of the stuff we'll do will be yet. Need to do some testing.
